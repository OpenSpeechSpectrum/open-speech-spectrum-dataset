# open-speech-spectrum-dataset

An open-source voice dataset for atypical speech and inclusive speech AI.

OpenSpeechSpectrum is a community-driven project focused on building and sharing high-quality voice datasets that represent atypical speech patterns — including stuttering, cluttering, and other non-standard speech styles. We aim to support the development of more inclusive, ethical, and accessible voice AI technologies.

## 🌍 Why OpenSpeechSpectrum?
Most voice datasets today are built around "fluent" or "standard" speech — leaving behind millions of people whose speech patterns don’t fit the norm. This leads to biased speech recognition systems and limited access for many users.

OpenSpeechSpectrum changes that by:

- 🧠 Centering atypical speech in dataset design.

- 🎙️ Supporting English with a wide range of accents and disfluencies.

- 🌐 Promoting inclusive, open AI research and development.

- 🤝 Partnering with researchers, technologists, and lived-experience communities.

## What Counts as Atypical Speech?

We’re starting small with three categories:

- **Stuttering (Stammering)**:
Speech with blocks, repetitions, prolongations, and secondary behaviors.

 - **Cluttering**:
Rapid or irregular speech that can be hard to understand.

 - **Speech Sound Disorder (Articulation-based)**:
Includes lisps, substitutions (“wabbit” for “rabbit”), or distortions.


### We’ll add more with community input — such as aphasia, speech impacted by neurological conditions, other voice disorders, etc.

# Project Goals

- Collect open-licensed voice samples with atypical speech.

- Document and label data with empathy, accuracy, and consent.

- Foster collaboration between affected communities and developers.

- Build tools for contributing, validating, and exploring data.
